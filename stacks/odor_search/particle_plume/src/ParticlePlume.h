	 *
	 * This class receives data from electronic noses converting the chemical concentration data into a virtual plume.
	 * This virtual plume is represented by a 3D cloud of particles where a higher concentration of particles indicates a higher chemical concentration.
	 * Each chemical reading is converted into a small cloud of particles centered around the reading point over a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 1.
	 * Chemical data can be gathered from multiple sources, various sensors on a robot, various robots, stationary sensor network nodes, etc.
